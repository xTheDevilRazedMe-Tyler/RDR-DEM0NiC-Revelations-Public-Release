What Are The Required XML Files & Why Are They Needed
------------------------------------------------------
1. These files are Rideable Animal Bypass speed files to make animals move when using the animal bypass mod option in the mod menu. The script rideable animal bypass
is much different than the original rideable animal bypass, this version does not require a modified componets file to let you ride every animal.
This version also properly lets you mount all animals and let's you use weapons when riding them, so the use of TNT/FireBottle is no longer needed.

2. Super Run: In the model changer the Nun model has super speed but only if you use the required xml file for the nun.
The reason is so you dont have to make just your player have super run all the time[gent], so this is kind of a toggable super run.
Change to nun you'll have super run, die or change your model to anything other than the nun and your speed will turn back to normal.
- Feel free to modify the nun file to have far mount and super far knife range how the original gent mods were created.

3. Also these animal speed files have been updated and now have very smooth turn rates compared to the old versions.
-- Some birds still need modified so they arent floating in the air, will be fixed in a later update as it's not a priority ATM.
