Spectate:
-----------
- Once a player dies, you must press B/O to reset cam and yourself,
or else cam will be stuck looking at dead player even if they respawn
Must re-spectate to spectate again (couldnt find a proper fix without looping which in itself would cause issues)

Demi God Dead State Bug:
--------------------------
While using demi god you may encounter the dead state bug, what this is, is if you manage to die with demi god on you could be stuck dead forever.
Sometimes the easiest fix is just turn demi god off until you respawn or switch sessions, ideally this bug mostly occurs when you have changed your model.

Demi God Is Helpful Bug:
------------------------
Okay so this sounds misleading, this is more of a accidental feature more than I will classify this as a bug.
If you hold a TNT and explode yourself when demi god is on, this actually makes you almost true god mode.
You are immune to everything except the explosive rifle
As a bonus you can now walk under water now also!.
Doing this can also bypass dead state bug but could break xp mod for others.

XP Mod For Others Dead State Bug/Announcer Spam:
-----------------------------------------------
The XP for others mod uses a varation of demi god, if the player getting xp dies and you cancel transport or respawn, you might get the dead state bug.
The easiest fix for this is 
1. Do not cancel transport and let the player come back and punch you again to get xp then cancel transport.
2. Turn demi god on, then back off or switch sessions.
3. Just tell the other player not to die lmao.
-- If you get spam by the announcer saying stuff when doing xp to others, both players need to die when XP for others mod is turned off.


Antifreeze Bugs:
-----------------
Antfreeze should ONLY really be used when you see a abusive modder [ideally a modder who drops wagons and freezes people]
join the game. Turn on antifreeze and then you can freeze the abusive modder via network options, once that person has left
the game you then turn antifreeze off, you then rinse and repeat as needed.

1. Here is where bugs come into play, do not go to outfitter, or try to join a new session or any minigames etc
when antifreeze is on because you will get stuck in a never ending loading screen state.
2. Antifreeze is not a 100% gurantee protection againt being frozen, its been tested against town wagons, all varaitions of full session freeze wagons, Zombie riders,
John marston freeze [Seems to be just a xbox exploit?], and undead giant bat rider freezers [these are random when they want to freeze people but it's the size of a town wagon, and could be xbox only].
The antifreeze also protects against the freeze ped mod option in the mod menu itself as well.

This antifreeze has proved to work against all of these types of freezes as is, and we have yet been frozen by any of them, however as a warning we can't 100% gurantee that
the antifreeze wont protect against other kinds of freezes rather they be public known methods or private methods. For the most part tho it protects against all standard ways of
freezing people.
