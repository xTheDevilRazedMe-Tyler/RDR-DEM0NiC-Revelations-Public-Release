Be sure to extract your normal fuieventmonitor and name it as fuieventmonitor_o
-- That _o is not a zero!

This is very important that you name it properly and that you re-import it directly where fuieventmonitor is.

Follow the tut videos on how to do this or you will encounter random freezes
if you dont extract the ORIGINAL fuieventmonitor, then rename it, then re-import it
back, using AreDeAre!

The tut videos go over this in depth so be sure to watch them!

read the READ .txt doc for tut links!!!!
